    "text": "It started at NextShark, where I helped transform a scrappy financial news site into a cultural powerhouse for Asian American voices. We were a small team with big ambition, and I led the charge in growing our audience organically—reaching over 20 million people a month and turning Instagram into a hub for 150,000+ monthly engagements. That experience taught me how to move fast, ride trends, and build loyal communities from the ground up.\n\n\n\nAt Pollen, I stepped into a hybrid creative-strategic role, designing social content while brokering high-impact partnerships—like a $250K deal with Bumble. It was fast-paced, experimental, and a crash course in what it means to blend culture with commerce.\n\n\n\nThat balance of creativity and structure came into sharper focus at Hyatt Hotels, where I managed marketing efforts for three hotels under two global brands. I built campaign calendars around major events like the Long Beach Grand Prix, maintained brand consistency across channels, and advised internal teams on best practices. I learned how to operate within brand systems—without losing the human voice behind the content.\n\n\n\nThen came Monster Energy, where I took on the digital “eyes and ears” of the brand. I developed campaign strategies that bridged live events and online presence, engaging fans in real time while protecting brand reputation. It was here that I really honed my skills in community management—knowing when to amplify, when to listen, and how to keep things authentic at scale.\n\n\n\nNow at Niagara Bottling, I’ve brought that full toolkit to a brand ready to grow. In under a year, I’ve led social strategy that more than doubled our audience and increased engagement by 1500%, all while cutting ad spend in half. I manage our external agency with a tight grip on brand consistency and a wide lens for creative opportunities. We’re not just selling water—we’re building a brand people actually want to follow."
